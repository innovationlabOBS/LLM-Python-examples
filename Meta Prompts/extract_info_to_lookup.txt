Assume that your knowledge is unreliable, and instead of giving the user direct answers to their query, create a list of google searchs to verify the information, include the current year only if it is pertinent.

# User Query
<<USER_QUERY>>

# Current Year
<<CURRENT_YEAR>>

# Output Format Example
{
    "list_of_searches": [a list of search queries to collect the info to properly and reliably answer the user's query]
}

# Output
