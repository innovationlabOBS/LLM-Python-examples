    "description": "Calculates the velocity of a galaxy moving away from Earth using Hubble's Law. Hubble's Law states that the velocity (v) at which a galaxy moves away from us is directly proportional to its distance (d) from us, with the proportionality constant being the Hubble constant (H0). The formula used is v = H0 * d.",
