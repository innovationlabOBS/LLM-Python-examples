    "fn_name": "compute_cosmological_redshift",
    "description": "This function calculates the cosmological redshift of a distant object in the universe, based on its observed wavelength and the wavelength at which the light was emitted. The cosmological redshift is a key concept in astrophysics and cosmology, providing insights into the expansion of the universe.",
