# Background Information
feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep). 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. 6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation. 7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful conse­ quences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharac­ teristic of the individual when not symptomatic. D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by others. E. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupa­ tional functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic. F. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment). Note: A full hypomanie episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a hypomanie episode diagnosis. However, caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly in­ creased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanie episode, nor necessarily indicative of a bi­ polar diathesis. Note: Criteria A-'F constitute a hypomanie episode. Hypomanie episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. Major Depressive Episode A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condi­ tion. 1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjec­ tive report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.) 2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation). 3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.) 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day. 5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down). 6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delu­ sional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick). 8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (ei­ ther by subjective account or as observed by others). 9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation with­ out a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa­ tional, or other important areas of functioning. C. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Note: Criteria A-C constitute a major depressive episode. Major depressive episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Cri­ terion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be un­ derstandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.^ Bipolar I Disorder A. Criteria have been met for at least one manic episode (Criteria A-D under “Manic Ep­ isode” above). B. The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional dis­ order, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. Coding and Recording Procedures The diagnostic code for bipolar I disorder is based on type of current or most recent epi­ sode and its status with respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met for a manic or major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only indicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a manic, hypomanie, or major depres­ sive episode. Codes are as follows: Bipolar 1 disorderCurrent or most recent episode manicCurrent or most recent episode hypomanie*Current or most recent episode depressedCurrent or most recent episode unspecified** Mild (p. 154) 296.41 ΝΑ 296.51 NA (F31.11) (F31.31) Moderate (p. 154) 296.42 ΝΑ 296.52 NA (F31.12) (F31.32) Severe (p. 154) 296.43 ΝΑ 296.53 NA (F31.13) (F31.4) ^ In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in MDE it is persistent depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity over days to W feeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders
1. Feeling keyed up or tense. 2. Feeling unusually restless. 3. Difficulty concentrating because of worry. 4. Fear that something awful may happen. 5. Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself. Specify current severity: IMild: Two symptoms. ■Moderate: Three symptoms. ■Moderate-severe: Four or five symptoms. Severe: Four or five symptoms and with motor agitation. Note: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and ma­ jor depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health settings. High levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of ill­ ness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment. Witli mixed features: A. At least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present nearly every day during the majority of days of a major depressive episode: 1. Elevated, expansive mood. 2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually). 6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual in­ discretions, foolish business investments). 7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia). B. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the per­ son’s usual behavior. C. For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or hypomania, the diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. D. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment). Note: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment. With melancholic features: A. One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current epi­ sode: 1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities. 2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even temporarily, when something good happens). B. Three (or more) of the following; 1. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood. 2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning. 3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening). 4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation. 5. Significant anorexia or weight loss. 6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt. Note: The specifier “ with melancholic features” is applied if these features are present at the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of the ca­ pacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reac­ tivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked brightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens only partially (e.g., up to 20%-^0% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “ distinct quality” of mood that is characteristic of the “ with melancholic features” specifier is experienced as qual­ itatively different from that during a nonmelancholic depressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a rea­ son is not considered distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always pres­ ent and are observable by others. Melancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the same individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and are more likely to occur in those with psychotic features. With atypical features: This specifier can be applied when these features predomi­ nate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder. A. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events). B. Two (or more) of the following: 1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite. 2. Hypersomnia. 3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs). 4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to epi­ sodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational im­ pairment. C. Criteria are not met for “ with melancholic features” or “ with catatonia” during the same episode. Note: “ Atypical depression” has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradistinction to the more classical agitated, “ endogenous” presentations of depression that were the norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in ado­ lescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an uncommon or unusual clin­ ical presentation as the term might imply. Mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive events (e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become euthymie (not sad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances remain favorable. Increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical features, pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists
the degree to which presence of the disorder raises the likelihood of comorbid substance abuse. While these findings suggest substantial cultural differences in the expression of major depressive disorder, they do not permit simple linkages be­ tween particular cultures and the likelihood of specific symptoms. Rather, clinicians should be aware that in most countries the majority of cases of depression go unrecog­ nized in primary care settings and that in many cultures, somatic symptoms are very likely to constitute the presenting complaint. Among the Criterion A symptoms, insomnia and loss of energy are the most uniformly reported. Gender-Related Diagnostic issues Although the möst reproducible finding in the epidemiology of major depressive disorder has been a higher prevalence in females, there are no clear differences between genders in symptoms, course, treatment response, or functional consequences. In w ^om en, the risk for suicide attempts is higher, and the risk for suicide completion is lower. The disparity in suicide rate by gender is not as great among those with depressive disorders as it is in the population as a whole. Suicide Risic The possibility of suicidal behavior exists at all times during major depressive episodes. The most consistently described risk factor is a past history of suicide attempts or threats, but it should be remembered that most completed suicides are not preceded by unsuccess­ ful attempts. Other features associated with an increased risk for completed suicide include male sex, being single or living alone, and having prominent feelings of hopeless­ ness. The presence of borderline personality disorder markedly increases risk for future suicide attempts. Functional Consequences of iVlajor Depressive Disorder Many of the functional consequences of major depressive disorder derive from individual symptoms. Impairment can be very mild, such that many of those who interact with the af­ fected individual are unaware of depressive symptoms. Impairment may, however, range to complete incapacity such that the depressed individual is unable to attend to basic self­ care needs or is mute or catatonic. Among individuals seen in general medical settings, those with major depressive disorder have more pain and physical illness and greater de­ creases in physical, social, and role functioning. Differential Diagnosis Manic episodes with irritable mood or mixed episodes. Major depressive episodes with prominent irritable mood may be difficult to distinguish from manic episodes with irritable mood or from mixed episodes. This distinction requires a careful clinical evalua­ tion of the presence of manic symptoms. Mood disorder due to another medical condition. A major depressive episode is the appropriate diagnosis if the mood disturbance is not judged, based on individual history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, to be the direct pathophysiological conse­ quence of a specific medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism). Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder. This disorder is distin­ guished from major depressive disorder by the fact that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) appears to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. For ex­ ample, depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced depressive disorder. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Distractibility and low frustration tolerance can occur in both attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and a major depressive epi­ sode; if the criteria are met for both, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be diag­ nosed in addition to the mood disorder. However, the clinician must be cautious not to overdiagnose a major depressive episode in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder whose disturbance in mood is characterized by irritability rather than by sadness or loss of interest. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood. A major depressive episode that occurs in response to a psychosocial stressor is distinguished from adjustment disorder w ^ ith de­ pressed mood by the fact that the full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met in adjustment disorder. Sadness. Finally, periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human experience. These periods should not be diagnosed as a major depressive episode unless criteria are met for severity (i.e., five out of nine symptoms), duration (i.e., most of the day, nearly ev­ ery day for at least 2 w ^eeks), and clinically significant distress or impairment. The diagno­ sis other specified depressive disorder may be appropriate for presentations of depressed mood wiih clinically significant impairment that do not meet criteria for duration or se­ verity. Comorbidity Other disorders with which major depressive disorder frequently co-occurs are substance- related disorders, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, buli­ mia nervosa, and borderline personality disorder. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) Diagnostic Criteria 300.4 (F34.1) This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-lV-defined chronic major depressive dis­ order and dysthymic disorder. A. Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, as indicated by either subjective account or observation by others, for at least 2 years. Note: In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and duration must be at least 1 year. B. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following: 1. Poor appetite or overeating. 2. Insomnia or hypersomnia. 3. Low energy or fatigue. 4. Low self-esteem. 5. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions. 6. Feelings of hopelessness. C. During the 2-year period ( 1 year for children or adolescents) of the disturbance, the individ­ ual has never been without the symptoms in Criteria A and B for more than 2 months at a time. D. Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously present for 2 years. E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanie episode, and criteria have never been met for cyclothymic disorder. F. The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. G. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism). H. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Note: Because the criteria for a major depressive
eat more and may crave specific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in either direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3). Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping exces­ sively (Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle in- sonrmia (i.e., waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i.e., waking too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial in­ somnia (i.e., difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with over­ sleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. Sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the dis­ turbed sleep. Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing, hand- wringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased in volume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or muteness) (Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe enough to be ob­ servable by others and not represent merely subjective feelings. Decreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). A person may re­ port sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to require substantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For example, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are ex­ hausting and take twice as long as usual. The sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may in­ clude unrealistic negative evaluations of one's worth or guilty preoccupations or rumina­ tions over minor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individuals often misinterpret neutral or trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense of responsibility for untoward events. The sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delu­ sional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced that he or she is personally re­ sponsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet occupational or inteφersonal responsibilities as a result of the depression is very common and, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to meet this criterion. Many individuals report impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make even minor decisions (Criterion A8). They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory diffi­ culties. Those engaged in cognitively demanding pursuits are often unable to function. In children, a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration. In elderly individ­ uals, memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs of a dementia (''pseudodementia"). When the major depressive episode is successfully treated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particu­ larly elderly persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial presenta­ tion of an irreversible dementia. Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common. They may range from a passive wish not to awaken in the morning or a belief that others would be better off if the individual were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of com­ mitting suicide, to a specific suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals may have put their affairs in order (e.g., updated wills, settled debts), acquired needed materials (e.g., a rope or a gun), and chosen a location and time to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for suicide may include a desire to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles, an intense wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emo­ tional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not be a burden to others. The resolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful measure of diminished suicide risk than denial of further plans for suicide. The evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult when they occur in an individual who also has a general medical condition (e.g., cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, pregnancy). Some of the criterion signs and symp­ toms of a major depressive episode are identical to those of general medical conditions (e.g., weight loss with untreated diabetes; fatigue with cancer; hypersomnia early in preg­ nancy; insonmia later in pregnancy or the postpartum). Such symptoms count toward a major depressive diagnosis except when they are clearly and fully attributable to a general medical condition. Nonvegetative symptoms of dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or worthless­ ness, impaired concentration or indecision, and suicidal thoughts should be assessed with particular care in such cases. Definitions of major depressive episodes that have been mod­ ified to include only these nonvegetative symptoms appear to identify nearly the same in­ dividuals as do the full criteria. Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Major depressive disorder is associated with high mortality, much of which is accounted for by suicide; however, it is not the only cause. For example, depressed individuals ad­ mitted to nursing homes have a markedly increased likelihood of death in the first year. In­ dividuals frequently present with tearfulness, irritability, brooding, obsessive rumination, anxiety, phobias, excessive worry over physical health, and complaints of pain (e.g., head­ aches; joint, abdominal, or other pains). In children, separation anxiety may occur. Although an extensive literature exists describing neuroanatomical, neuroendocrino­ logical, and neurophysiological correlates of major depressive disorder, no laboratory test has yielded results of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as a diagnostic tool for this disorder. Until recently, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity had been the most extensively investigated abnormality associated v^ith major depressive episodes, and it appears to be associated with melancholia, psychotic features, and risks for eventual suicide. Molecular studies have also implicated peripheral factors, including genetic vari­ ants in neurotrophic factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies provide evidence for functional abnormalities in spe­ cific neural
derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about "joining" the deceased, whereas in MDE such thoughts are focused on ending one's own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression. Coding and Recording Procedures The diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on whether this is a single or recurrent episode, current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met for a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only indicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode. Codes are as follows: Severity/course specifier Single episode Recurrent episode* Mild (p. 188) 296.21 (F32.0) 296.31 (F33.0) Moderate (p. 188) 296.22 (F32.1) 296.32 (F33.1) Severe (p. 188) 296.23 (F32.2) 296.33 (F33.2) With psychotic features** (p. 186) 296.24 (F32.3) 296.34 (F33.3) In partial remission (p. 188) 296.25 (F32.4) 296.35 (F33.41) In full remission (p. 188) 296.26 (F32.5) 296.36 (F33.42) Unspecified 296.20 (F32.9) 296.30 (F33.9) *For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. The defini­ tions of specifiers are found on the indicated pages. **If psychotic features are present, code the "with psychotic features" specifier irrespective of epi­ sode severity. In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: major depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current episode. Specify: With anxious distress (p. 184) With mixed features (pp. 184-185) With melancholic features (p. 185) With atypical features (pp. 185-186) With mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 186) With mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 186) With catatonia (p. 186). Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1). With péripartum onset (pp. 186-187) With seasonal pattern (recurrent episode only) (pp. 187-188) Diagnostic Features The criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present nearly every day to be considered present, with the exception of weight change and suicidal ideation. De­ pressed mood must be present for most of the day, in addition to being present nearly ev­ ery day. Often insomnia or fatigue is the presenting complaint, and failure to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms will result in underdiagnosis. Sadness may be de­ nied at first but may be elicited through interview or inferred from facial expression and demeanor. With individuals who focus on a somatic complaint, clinicians should de­ termine whether the distress from that complaint is associated with specific depressive symptoms. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psy­ chomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall sever­ ity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt. The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least 2 weeks during w ^hich there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activi­ ties (Criterion A). In children and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad. The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list that includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased en­ ergy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making deci­ sions; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To count toward a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or must have clearly worsened compared with the person's pre-episode status. The symptoms must persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The ep­ isode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occu­ pational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal but requires markedly increased effort. The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or "down in the dumps" (Criterion Al). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out that the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals who complain of feeling "blah," having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood can be inferred from the person's facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals em­ phasize somatic complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of sadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be dif­ ferentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated. Loss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some degree. Individ­ uals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, "not caring anymore," or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a for­ merly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to practice). In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sex­ ual interest or desire. Appetite change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some depressed individ­ uals report that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and may crave specific foods (e.g., sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in either direction),

===============GPT Response================:

 Depression, clinically known as major depressive disorder, is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think, and how you act. It is characterized by a persistent feeling of sadness or a lack of interest in external stimuli. The condition can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.

According to the criteria for diagnosing major depressive disorder, a person must experience five or more of the following symptoms during the same 2-week period, and at least one of the symptoms should be either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure:

1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day.
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day.
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others).
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day.
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day.
9. Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.

The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning and are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.

Depression is more than just a bout of the blues and requires treatment. The condition can be long-lasting or recurrent, substantially impairing an individual’s ability to function in daily life. It can lead to suicide in severe cases. However, it is also treatable, and many people with depression experience relief through medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of both.
