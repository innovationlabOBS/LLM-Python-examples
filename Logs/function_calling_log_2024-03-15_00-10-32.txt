# Json format example
{
    "function_exists": <output YES or NO if the function is in the list>,
    "function_name": <name of the function, null if it doesn't exist>
}

# Json output (with no extra characters, as this wil break the parsing of this output)

===============GPT_CALL_CHECK_FN_EXISTS Response================:

 {
    "function_exists": "YES",
    "function_name": "multiply_numbers"
}

===============GPT_CALL_GET_FN_PARAMS_FROM_USER_INPUT Prompt================:

 Given the following user query and python function definition, extract values for the input parameters to the function from the user query. Output them in the json format provided.

# User Query
<what is 547564 times 83726?>

# Function definition
{"function_description": "This function multiplies two numbers together.", "input_param_names": ["number1", "number2"], "output_param_name": "result", "code": "def multiply_numbers(number1, number2):\n    return number1 * number2", "function_name": "multiply_numbers"}

# Json format example
{
    "values_for_input_params": <user defined values for the input parameters of the function as a python list. Convert these values to be purely numerical and to work in the units that the function requires>
}

# Json output (with no extra characters, as this wil break the parsing of this output)

===============GPT_CALL_GET_FN_PARAMS_FROM_USER_INPUT Response================:
